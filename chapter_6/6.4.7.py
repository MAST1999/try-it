STRING OPERATIONS: Suppose that you have a list of strings in which
some (but not necessarily all) of the strings begin and end with the double
quote character:
x = ['"abc"', 'def', '"ghi"', '"klm"', 'nop']
What code would you use on each element to remove just the double quotes?
What code could you use to find the position of the last p in Mississippi?
When youâ€™ve found that position, what code would you use to remove just
that letter?
